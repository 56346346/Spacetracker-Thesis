# Methodology & System Design

\subsection{3.2 System Architecture Overview}

The SpaceTracker system implements object-level synchronization for BIM collaboration, replacing traditional file-based federation with real-time, element-granular coordination between multiple Autodesk Revit sessions. The architecture follows an event-driven pattern centered around a Neo4j graph database serving as the authoritative data repository.

**Figure: High-level component diagram** - showing the integration between Authoring Tool (Revit Add-in), Graph Repository (Neo4j), Change Detection Engine, Session Management, and External Validation Service (Solibri).

The system comprises five primary architectural components:

**Authoring Integration** manages the bi-directional interface with Revit through a comprehensive add-in that captures document events, serializes architectural elements (walls, doors, pipes, provisional spaces), and applies remote changes within controlled transactions. This component ensures atomicity of operations and handles cross-session element identity mapping through parameter-based tagging.

**Change Detection and Patch Builder** continuously monitors document modifications and generates element-level change events. The system employs geometric comparison algorithms to detect spatial relationship modifications, including door-wall hosting, pipe-wall intersections, and pipe-provisional space containment. Changes are serialized as property dictionaries with precise coordinate transformations from Revit's internal foot-based units to metric storage.

**Graph Synchronization Service** orchestrates the central coordination logic through a ChangeLog-based protocol. Each modification generates timestamped ChangeLog entries targeting specific sessions, enabling precise change tracking and conflict-free propagation. The service maintains session isolation while ensuring consistent change ordering through temporal sequencing.

**Session Management** tracks concurrent user sessions and their synchronization timestamps. The system supports multi-user scenarios with session-based access control and maintains minimal database round-trips through batched command processing.

**Validation Integration** provides automated rule-based validation through REST API integration with Solibri. The system exchanges partial model data for rule execution and processes validation results as structured feedback within the collaboration workflow.

The data flow operates through bidirectional pathways: outbound operations serialize local Revit elements into graph nodes using geometric coordinates and parametric properties, while inbound operations reconstruct remote elements from graph properties within atomic Revit transactions. Change propagation follows an event-driven notification pattern with automatic pull triggers when remote modifications are detected.

Identity management employs a dual-layer approach: primary identification through Revit ElementIds with secondary cross-session mapping via parameter-based tags. The system maintains spatial relationship consistency through geometric intersection testing and relationship inference algorithms.

Deployment follows a distributed topology with local Revit plugins connecting to a central Neo4j instance, complemented by external validation services. The architecture ensures transaction atomicity through Revit's native transaction system while providing rollback capabilities on operation failures.

\subsection{3.3 Graph Data Model Design (Nodes and Relationships)}

The system adopts a Labeled Property Graph (LPG) model specifically designed for architectural element coordination and spatial relationship traversal. The graph schema abstracts BIM semantics into traversable network structures optimized for real-time collaboration queries.

**Node Types and Properties:**

**Element Nodes** represent architectural components with geometric and parametric properties. Wall nodes contain linear geometry (x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2 coordinates), type identification (typeName, familyName), thickness measurements, location line specifications, and structural properties. Door nodes capture point locations (x,y,z), dimensional properties (width, height), and host relationships. Pipe nodes store linear geometry with diameter and system type classifications. Provisional space nodes represent spatial boundaries with bounding box definitions and volumetric properties.

**Infrastructure Nodes** support system operations and metadata management. Level nodes maintain elevation data and unique identifiers for vertical positioning. Session nodes track user activity with synchronization timestamps and active status indicators. ChangeLog nodes encode modification events with operation types (Create/Modify/Delete), target session identifiers, acknowledgment status, and temporal sequencing.

**Relationship Types and Semantics:**

**Spatial Containment** relationships model hierarchical spatial organization. ON_LEVEL relationships connect elements to their vertical positioning context. HOSTED_BY relationships represent element dependencies, particularly door-wall hosting relationships that maintain geometric constraints.

**Geometric Intersection** relationships capture spatial interdependencies discovered through automated analysis. INTERSECTS relationships identify pipe-wall intersections based on bounding box overlap testing. CONTAINED_IN relationships represent pipe-provisional space containment derived from geometric inclusion algorithms.

**Change Propagation** relationships enable the synchronization protocol. CHANGED relationships connect ChangeLog entries to their target elements, supporting temporal change sequencing and acknowledgment tracking.

**Identity and Metadata Strategy:**

The system employs multi-layered identity management combining stable ElementIds with cross-session mapping capabilities. Temporal metadata includes modification timestamps for change ordering and provenance tracking for audit capabilities. Geometric properties are stored in metric units with high-precision coordinate values to ensure consistency across coordinate system transformations.

**Change Representation:**

Modifications are modeled as discrete ChangeLog nodes containing operation semantics and target references. The system supports insert, update, and delete operations with full property change tracking. Graph transformations maintain referential integrity through relationship updates and cascade operations for dependent elements.

**Query Pattern Support:**

The graph model optimizes several critical query patterns: **Impact Analysis** traverses relationship networks to identify elements affected by modifications. **Neighborhood Queries** support spatial proximity analysis for conflict detection and geometric constraint validation. **Change Sequencing** enables temporal ordering of modifications for consistent application across sessions. **Validation Scoping** allows selective rule application based on modified element neighborhoods.

The model deliberately abstracts from native IFC representations to optimize graph traversal performance and enable partial update operations without requiring complete model reconstruction. This design choice prioritizes collaboration efficiency over standards compliance, supporting rapid change propagation and incremental synchronization.

\subsection{3.4 Requirements Analysis and Extensibility}

**Functional Requirements:**

The system implements object-level synchronization enabling real-time collaboration between multiple Revit sessions. Core functionality includes bidirectional element synchronization supporting walls, doors, pipes, and provisional spaces with geometric precision and parametric property preservation. The change detection system automatically identifies document modifications and generates corresponding database updates with minimal user intervention.

Selective validation capabilities integrate rule-based checking through external validation services. The system supports automated impact analysis identifying elements affected by modifications and enabling targeted validation scoping. Spatial relationship inference maintains geometric dependencies including hosting relationships and intersection detection.

Cross-session identity mapping enables consistent element identification across distributed authoring environments. The system provides conflict-free change propagation through event-driven synchronization protocols with temporal ordering guarantees.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

**Multi-User Consistency:** The system implements session-based isolation with atomic change application. Consistency semantics follow an eventually consistent model with conflict resolution through last-writer-wins policies. Transaction boundaries ensure complete change sets are applied atomically within individual Revit sessions.

**Performance Constraints:** The architecture targets interactive feedback with sub-second change propagation latency. The system maintains responsiveness during concurrent editing scenarios with up to ten simultaneous users. Geometric operations are optimized for precision with coordinate transformations maintaining accuracy within architectural tolerances.

**Scalability Characteristics:** The design accommodates projects with thousands of architectural elements through incremental synchronization and batched database operations. Memory management strategies handle large element collections through streaming operations and cached type information.

**Extensibility Architecture:**

**Discipline Integration** supports adding new element types through modular serializer components and corresponding graph node definitions. The system isolates element-specific logic within dedicated serialization modules, enabling independent extension without core system modifications.

**Validation Framework Extension** accommodates new rule sets through configurable validation service integration. The modular design allows additional validation providers through standardized REST API contracts.

**Relationship Type Expansion** supports new spatial relationship patterns through extensible relationship detection algorithms. The graph schema accommodates additional relationship types without requiring fundamental architectural changes.

**Event Source Integration** enables integration with additional authoring tools through standardized change event interfaces. The abstract change detection framework supports diverse input sources while maintaining consistent internal change representation.

**Operational Concerns:**

**Observability and Traceability:** The system provides comprehensive logging for all synchronization operations with detailed change audit trails. Performance metrics track synchronization latency, database operation timing, and validation processing duration. Error tracking captures synchronization failures with detailed context for troubleshooting.

**Rollback and Recovery:** Transaction-based operations ensure atomic failure handling with automatic rollback capabilities. The system maintains operation logs enabling manual recovery procedures for complex failure scenarios.

**Deployment Flexibility:** The architecture supports various deployment topologies from local development environments to distributed enterprise configurations. Configuration management accommodates different database connection parameters and validation service endpoints.

**Standards Alignment:**

The system architecture aligns with collaborative BIM workflows while prioritizing real-time performance over exhaustive standards compliance. The design accommodates future integration with established BIM protocols through abstraction layers and standardized interfaces.

\paragraph{Design Rationale (for Chapter 5.2)}

**5.2.1 Why Not a SQL Database?**
The system employs a graph database to optimize traversal of complex spatial relationships inherent in architectural coordination. Traditional relational databases require multiple joins to navigate element containment, intersection, and dependency relationships, creating performance bottlenecks for real-time collaboration queries. Graph databases enable single-hop traversal of spatial neighborhoods, supporting efficient impact analysis and conflict detection. The ChangeLog-based synchronization model benefits from graph structures through direct relationship modeling between change events and affected elements, eliminating complex foreign key relationships required in relational schemas.

**5.2.2 RDF vs. Property Graph Trade-offs**
The implementation adopts a Labeled Property Graph (LPG) model through Neo4j to optimize query ergonomics and traversal performance for real-time collaboration scenarios. Property graphs provide direct attribute storage on nodes and relationships, eliminating the triple expansion overhead of RDF representations. The system prioritizes query performance and development velocity over semantic web interoperability, as architectural collaboration requires rapid spatial relationship traversal rather than formal ontological reasoning.

**5.2.3 Graph Model vs. Native IFC Representation**
The system abstracts IFC structures into graph representations to enable partial updates and incremental synchronization without complete model reconstruction. Native IFC representations optimize for comprehensive building model exchange but create barriers for real-time collaboration through their emphasis on complete model consistency. The graph abstraction supports selective element synchronization and spatial relationship queries while maintaining essential geometric and parametric properties required for architectural coordination.

**5.2.4 Integration via REST API to Solibri**
The system integrates validation services through REST API protocols to maintain loose coupling between collaboration and validation concerns. This architectural choice enables validation service substitution and supports asynchronous validation workflows without blocking synchronization operations. The REST integration exchanges partial model data and validation results through standardized JSON protocols, enabling validation scoping based on modified element neighborhoods rather than complete model validation.

**5.2.5 Multi-User Collaboration and Data Consistency**
The system implements eventually consistent semantics with session-based isolation to balance collaboration responsiveness with data integrity. The ChangeLog-based protocol ensures all sessions receive identical change sequences while allowing independent application timing. Conflict resolution employs temporal ordering with last-writer-wins semantics for property conflicts, prioritizing collaboration continuity over complex merge logic that could disrupt real-time workflows.

**5.2.6 Real-Time Performance Constraints**
The architecture targets sub-second change propagation to maintain interactive collaboration responsiveness evidenced through the automated pull notification system. Performance optimization focuses on incremental operations, batched database commands, and geometric operation precision to minimize synchronization latency. The system prioritizes collaboration continuity over exhaustive validation, supporting selective rule application based on change impact analysis.

**5.2.7 Scalability to Larger Projects**
The design employs incremental synchronization patterns with batched command processing to accommodate growing project complexity. Scalability strategies include geometric query optimization through spatial indexing considerations, element collection caching during operations, and minimal database round-trips through command queue accumulation. The session management approach supports concurrent user scaling through isolated change processing and temporal change ordering.
